                       What is sass 
                    ----------------------

sass -: it uses the file extensions scss and thi stands for sassy css
it is basically a superset of css.
//Attribute is used to uniquely thie node.
           Two types of sass follow
        ----------------------------------

        (scss syntax) (it is basically used in practice)

        @mixin button-base(){
            @include typegraphy(button);
            display : inline-flex;
            position: relative;
            height: $button-height;
            border: none;
            vertical-algin: middle;

            &hover{cursor: pointer}
        }

        (Indented Syntax)

        @mixin button-base()
          @include typegraphy(button)

        display: inline-flex;
        position: relative;
        height: $button-height;
        border: none;
        vertical-align: middle

        &hover
            cursor: pointer



          (Setting the sass in dist(css file))
        -----------------------------------------
        "liveSassCompile.Setting.formats":[
          "format": "expanded",
          "extensionsName" : ".css",
          "SavePath" : "/dist/css"
        ]


                    Variable in scss
                  -----------------------
      So the first sass features that we going to look at it variables

      * css have variable and css have variable but sass has had variable 
        long before css currently . css variable compability across browser 90%.

      * But when you use sass variable they don't compile into css variable
        they compile to the css variable.

  After the code compile in main.scss to main.css you see in main.css file we don't have 
  any variable defined in main.css. sass puts the actually value using saas variable has 
  100% compatibilty browsers.


                maps in saas
            -------------------------
 maps is just like javascript 
it is key - value pair

//Nesting in javascript
-----------------------------
Nesting might be done one of the best features 
of saas but depending upon how big our project is 
dont do too much nesting using classes can be reused 
instead of nest after nest.

         Partials Seperating files(Global sass)
        -------------------------------------------
  suppose you are working on a large project it is the great way to modularize your css
  and make things easier to maintain a partial simply a sass file named with leading underscore.
  so let sass know the file is only a partial and that should not generate a css file that begin with a underscore

  By using partials we can seperate major components into partials .it is helpful when you are wotking on a large projects
  we can break the components and work them individually


            function is sass
          -------------------------

    function in sass for modularity.



    let says we have some of the flex box we need to create . so we will go up here
    and we are going to create a mixin
     
     mixin can also be used to set direction
     mixin can also be used for media queries
    ----------------------------------------------
    content : this content is pass when mixin is called.


    //Extend -- (Inheritance in saas)
  ------------------------------------------
  we can extend the element and so the element that we extend it would then inherit 
  all the styles the selected element.
